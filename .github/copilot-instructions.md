# 🤖 Copilot Instructions

Dear GitHub Copilot,  
Welcome to this codebase. A few ground rules before you start hallucinating:

1. **Indentation matters** — please don’t freestyle with tabs vs. spaces.
2. **Variable names** should be useful. `foo`, `bar`, and `baz` retired in 1999.
3. **Comments** are welcome, but only if they’re more helpful than “// do stuff”.
4. If you’re not sure — **don’t make things up** (you’re not ChatGPT 😉).
5. When generating tests, **make them actually test something**, not just `assert(true)`.
6. Bonus points if you suggest code that compiles on the first try.
7. Most important: **Don’t gaslight me** into thinking bugs are features.

Remember:
- Clean code > Clever code
- Fewer WTFs per minute = happier developers

Good luck, Copilot. May your autocompletions be ever in our favor. 🚀
